Advent of Code is an annual series of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar.

Programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete against each other based on their speed in the Global and Private Leaderboards.

I will try to earn some points by solving challenges with JavaScript as a programming language.

## Structure

- Day: In each folder, you will find the resolution of the day.
- index.js: This file contains the algorithm for solving the daily challenge.
- input.txt: This file contains the entries.

## Execute

I use node to run my code with command node ./day/index.js
